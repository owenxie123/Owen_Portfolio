# [Using Data to Power a $300M Campaign at University of San Francisco](https://www.salesforce.org/blog/data-powered-campaign-usf/)
An article showcasing my work

For several years, Tableau has served as the primary data analytics and visualization platform for the University of San Francisco (USF), a private university located on a beautiful 55-acre campus in the heart of San Francisco. With Tableau, the USF advancement team produces lists, dashboards, KPIs, automated reports, and predictive analytics. The tool also serves as a bridge to bring data together across platforms.

# [Project 1: How does US economy affect USF donor growth](https://github.com/owenxie123/Owen_Portfolio/blob/main/How_does_US_economy_affect_USF_donor_growth.pdf)

For any US higher education, large percentage of school’s operating budget came from endowment. Donating money to your college also helps give back to the next generation of students. The money that you donate to your school often goes to new scholarships and to help fund new programs for the next classes of students who will attend your college. Also, most rankings in national magazines rank colleges based on the percentage of alumni who gave back to their schools; higher donor counts would lead to higher rankings.  AT USF, our donor count numbers have been declining since 2008; and we have been searching for quite some time as to “why” our donor numbers have decreased. Previous economic studies have shown that economic factors have large impacts in annual charitable giving. So, how does the current economy affect the behavior of USF donors? What does this mean for us during economic shocks such as the COVID 19 economic crisis? In this project, we will try to uncover these questions by looking at our past donor data.

A coursework showcasing my Python skill

In this problem set, I examined data similar to the Pandora Ad Demand Paper, moved beyond treatment effects to investigate dosage, investigated how treatment effects change over time, used instrument variable to handle non-compliance in the experiment and Examined heterogeneous treatment effects.
