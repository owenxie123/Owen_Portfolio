# [Using Data to Power a $300M Campaign at University of San Francisco](https://www.salesforce.org/blog/data-powered-campaign-usf/)
An article showcasing my work

For several years, Tableau has served as the primary data analytics and visualization platform for the University of San Francisco (USF), a private university located on a beautiful 55-acre campus in the heart of San Francisco. With Tableau, the USF advancement team produces lists, dashboards, KPIs, automated reports, and predictive analytics. The tool also serves as a bridge to bring data together across platforms.

# [Project 1: How does US economy affect college donor growth](https://github.com/owenxie123/Owen_Portfolio/blob/main/How%20does%20US%20economy%20affect%20college%20donor%20growth.pdf)
A job-related project demonstrating my R skills and data visualization skills

For any US higher education, large percentage of school’s operating budget came from endowment. Donating money to your college also helps give back to the next generation of students. The money that you donate to your school often goes to new scholarships and to help fund new programs for the next classes of students who will attend your college. Also, most rankings in national magazines rank colleges based on the percentage of alumni who gave back to their schools; higher donor counts would lead to higher rankings.  Previous economic studies have shown that economic factors have large impacts in annual charitable giving. So, how does the current economy affect the behavior of college donors? What does this mean for us during economic shocks such as the COVID 19 economic crisis? In this project, we will try to uncover these questions by looking at our past donor data.

# [Project 2: A Sense SQL Challenge](https://github.com/owenxie123/Owen_Portfolio/blob/main/Sense_SQL_Challenge.sql)
A take-home challenge to demonstrate my SQL skills

Sense has a few dozen fake sensors deployed in a fake customer building. All sensors are expected to "report" to the Sense cloud on a roughly 10-minute cadence. When a sensor reports, it captures a count of all the people within its field of view. In this challenge, I needed to create a temporary View off of the person_counts table that has sensor_name and partition_id split out into their own columns, find the average person_count across sensor reports with a non-zero person_count by sensor by day across all days and find the “Device Heath” of each sensor across all days. 

# [Project 3: A Pandora AD Demand Analysis](https://github.com/owenxie123/Owen_Portfolio/blob/main/Dosage%2C_Timing%2C_and_IV.ipynb)
A coursework showcasing my Python skills

In this problem set, I examined data similar to the Pandora Ad Demand Paper, moved beyond treatment effects to investigate dosage, investigated how treatment effects change over time, used instrument variable to handle non-compliance in the experiment and Examined heterogeneous treatment effects.
