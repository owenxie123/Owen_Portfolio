An article showcasing my work

For several years, Tableau has served as the primary data analytics and visualization platform for the University of San Francisco (USF), a private university located on a beautiful 55-acre campus in the heart of San Francisco. With Tableau, the USF advancement team produces lists, dashboards, KPIs, automated reports, and predictive analytics. The tool also serves as a bridge to bring data together across platforms.
